# [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers 🚀](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)

Welcome to the Jupyter code notebooks of "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" by DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI. 🛠️

In this course, you will learn how to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to quickly build new and powerful applications. Using the OpenAI API, you'll be able to rapidly develop capabilities that learn to innovate and create value in ways that were previously cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or simply impossible. 🚀

This short course, taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI), will describe how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and demonstrate how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including:

- **[Summarizing](./3_summarizing.ipynb)** (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity) 📝
- **[Inferring](./4_inferring.ipynb)** (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction) 🧠
- **[Transforming Text](./5_transforming.ipynb)** (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction) 🔄
- **[Expanding](./6_expanding.ipynb)** (e.g., automatically writing emails) 📨

In addition, you'll learn two key principles for writing effective prompts, how to systematically engineer good prompts, and also learn to build a custom chatbot. 🤖

- **[Chatbot](./7_chatbot.ipynb)**

All concepts are illustrated with numerous examples, which you can experiment with directly in our Jupyter notebook environment to gain hands-on experience with prompt engineering. 🎓

Embark on this exciting journey and unlock the full potential of prompt engineering with ChatGPT! 🚀
