# [Building Systems with the ChatGPT API 🚀](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-systems-with-the-chatgpt-api/)

Welcome to the Jupyter notebooks of "Building Systems with the ChatGPT API" by DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI. 🛠️

## What you’ll learn in this course 🎓
In "Building Systems With The ChatGPT API", you will learn how to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a Large Language Model (LLM). Unlock new development capabilities and improve your efficiency in this brand new short course. 🚀

During this course, you will build:

- **Chains of Prompts** that interact with the completions of prior prompts. 🔗
- **Systems** where Python code interacts with both completions and new prompts. 💻
- **A Customer Service Chatbot** using all the techniques from this course. 🤖

You’ll learn how to apply these skills to practical scenarios, including classifying user queries to a chat agent’s response, evaluating user queries for safety, and processing tasks for chain-of-thought, multi-step reasoning. 🧠
