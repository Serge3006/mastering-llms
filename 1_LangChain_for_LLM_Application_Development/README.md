Welcome to LangChain for LLM Application Development! This course is designed to equip you with the essential skills required to expand the use cases and capabilities of Language Models (LLMs) in application development using the LangChain framework. 🛠️

Throughout this course, you will gain practical experience in the following key areas:

- **[Models, Prompts, and Parsers](./1_model_prompt_parser.ipynb)**: Learn how to interact with LLMs, provide prompts, and parse the responses effectively. 📚
- **[Memories for LLMs](./2_memory.ipynb)**: Understand how to utilize memories to store conversations and manage limited context space. 🧠
- **[Chains](./3_chains.ipynb)**: Master the art of creating sequences of operations. 🔗
- **[Question Answering over Documents](./4_QA.ipynb)**: Apply LLMs to your proprietary data and adapt them to meet your specific use case requirements. 📝
- **[Agents](./6_agents.ipynb)**: Explore the exciting and emerging development of LLMs as reasoning agents. 🕵️‍♂️

By the end of this course, you will have a robust model that can serve as a solid foundation for your exploration of diffusion models for your applications. 🎯

This one-hour course is instructed by Harrison Chase, the creator of LangChain, and Andrew Ng, a renowned figure in the field of AI. This course will significantly broaden your horizons for leveraging powerful language models, enabling you to create robust applications in a matter of hours. 🎓

Embark on this exciting journey and unlock the full potential of Language Models in application development! 🚀
